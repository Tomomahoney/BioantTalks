# BioantTalks
This is a repository of code from a workshop video I did for the BioAntTalks conference in May 2021. 
Included are: 
-3D meshes of a skull and mandible (originally created by Hannah Newrey and available from https://skfb.ly/6AvC6)
-3D mesh of a complete human vertebral column (from https://skfb.ly/6UBEQ)
-3D mesh of a region of interest cube of trabecular bone from a mouse tibia.
-Code used in the workshop (single commands in R)
-A batch script for modifying whole folders of meshes (in R)
